Here, I wanted to share my experiences writing personal statements over the years. I’ve previously written personal statements for fellowships and university admissions.</p> <p>What helped me the most while writing these statements was actually seeing other people’s examples, so I’ve provided my statements from the past and links to websites that contain many examples:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.ahadjawaid.com/assets/pdf/nsf-grfp-personal-statement.pdf">Personal statement for NSF Graduate Fellowship</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s">NSF Graduate Fellowship Personal Statements</a></li> </ul> <p>I’ll describe the approach I found logical for writing a personal statement. This may not be the best way for everyone, but it worked for me.</p> <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2> <p>Understanding the purpose of your writing is crucial, which means asking yourself: “What do I want my audience to get out of this?” For personal statements, this varies based on the audience. Depending on who they are, I emphasized different experiences to match the desired outcome.</p> <p>In fellowships, they often explicitly state what they’re looking for in a solicitation document. If none is available, contacting the fellowship officer for clarification is an option. For university admissions, you can reach out to departments to understand their selection criteria.</p> <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2> <p>The structure I used for my NSF Graduate Fellowship personal statement was:</p> <ol> <li><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li> <li><a href="#experiences">Intellectual Merit</a> (Experiences)</li> <li><a href="#broader-impacts">Broader Impacts</a></li> <li><a href="#future-goals">Future Goals</a></li> </ol> <p>For fellowships, a recommended structure is often provided, so refer to specific fellowship guidelines. Generally, the structure is designed to present a cohesive story that addresses all essential points.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>The introduction should draw the reader in, and many applicants do this through a personal anecdote. Here’s an example of the approach I used for the NSF fellowship:</p> <blockquote> <p>“python inputBankingInfo.py Running… Finished. And with that, it was done.” The perpetual twelve hours of weekly data entry into Excel spreadsheets had forever ended. As an assistant real estate manager, I was tasked with repetitive work, like data entry. Every day, I slogged through inputting tenants’ accounts payable into an Excel sheet, thinking there had to be a better way. That’s when I discovered <em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em>, my first programming book, and automated the data entry process—marking the beginning of my journey as a programmer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many successful introductions start with a story that engages the reader. For me, this example outlines how I got into programming. I’ve found that writing an introduction in a style you’re comfortable with is important; avoid forcing a tone that feels unnatural.</p> <p>Next, I used a time jump to bring my story to the present:</p> <blockquote> <p>Four short years later, I have written code for Amazon, one of the largest companies on the planet; taught hundreds of students about machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI); participated in hackathons across the country; researched synthetic human-like speech generation; now I’m working towards creating robots that can execute tasks defined in natural language, while also exploring ways to communicate with computers directly through our brains.</p> </blockquote> <p>I then addressed a potential weakness in my application:</p> <blockquote> <p>My journey into research wasn’t straightforward. I didn’t even know what it meant to do research until the summer before my third year of university, and I didn’t stick to a single lab throughout my undergraduate years. Although this may have resulted in fewer publications, it helped me discover my interests, become more independent as a scientist, and strengthened my conviction that I want to pursue a career in research.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, I acknowledged my limited publication record—a common metric of research success—while framing my diverse experiences positively.</p> <h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2> <p>The experiences section is usually simpler to write, and I found the STAR method effective. Commonly used in interviews, it helps in writing about experiences concisely:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Situation</strong>: Provide background.</li> <li><strong>Task</strong>: Explain what you were trying to accomplish.</li> <li><strong>Action</strong>: Describe the steps you took.</li> <li><strong>Result</strong>: Highlight the outcome.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s an example from my statement:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Situation</strong>: <blockquote> <p>During the summer before my junior year, I collaborated with Dr. Kangkook Jee in his System Security Lab at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Task</strong>: <blockquote> <p>My role was to extend the Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explainer algorithm to work with heterogeneous graphs, enabling us to generate explanations about why the GNN classifier detected a program as malicious based on the corresponding heterogeneous resource interaction graph.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Action</strong>: <blockquote> <p>After programming the algorithm, I validated its accuracy by applying it to a classifier trained on the MUTAG (Mutagenic Chemicals) dataset. I confirmed the reliability of the algorithm’s explanations by comparing the molecules it identified as most important for classification as a mutagenic compound to established scientific ground truths, finding a strong match with existing research.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Result</strong>: <blockquote> <p>This work led to my open-source contribution of the algorithm to the Deep Graph Library, the second-largest GNN library, and the algorithm was later used in the lab’s research publication.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Sometimes, even with a strong structure, an experience may not fit well into your narrative. In such cases, it’s worth pursuing new experiences that better support your story.</p> <h3 id="writing-results">Writing Results</h3> <p>When writing about results, it’s crucial to articulate the impact of your actions clearly. This can include tangible outcomes, like speed improvements, cost savings, or research publications. But when tangible metrics aren’t available, you can still highlight what you learned or the skills you developed.</p> <p>For example, a common job experience, like being a cashier, can be written from the perspective of the impact you made. Instead of saying, “I worked as a cashier at Walmart for four months,” you could frame it as: “I helped process approximately $100,000 in transactions over a four-month period, ensuring smooth and accurate customer interactions.” This shifts the focus to the benefit you created for the employer, making your contribution clearer and more impactful.</p> <p>Being creative with how you present your results can make a big difference. However, it’s essential to stay truthful and not exaggerate your impact. The goal is to frame your achievements in a way that emphasizes your contributions without distorting reality.</p> <h2 id="broader-impacts">Broader Impacts</h2> <p>Most personal statements require a section demonstrating how you’ll benefit others or society. For the NSF, this involves broader impacts like broadening participation in STEM. This section follows a modified STAR approach, with an added focus on future plans (STARF):</p> <ul> <li><strong>Situation</strong>: <blockquote> <p>When I first began learning about machine learning, I found the mathematical concepts intimidating.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Task</strong>: <blockquote> <p>This inspired me to help others by explaining these ideas in a more accessible way, only requiring a basic understanding of mathematics (such as understanding the slope of a line).</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Action</strong>: <blockquote> <p>To that end, I became the workshop lead for the Artificial Intelligence Society, a campus organization, where I developed and presented eleven workshops and led a team of four to create nine of those workshops. I particularly encouraged students from various backgrounds to attend my workshops, even if they didn’t have a background in computer science. These workshops covered areas such as Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Model Deployment, and Reinforcement Learning.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Results</strong>: <blockquote> <p>The largest event had around 300 participants, while on average, each workshop attracted 57 students. Our feedback data showed an average engagement rating of 4.1/5.0, with 96% of participants indicating they learned something new.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Future</strong>: <blockquote> <p>Moving forward, I plan to continue educating students through workshops and YouTube videos, presenting AI techniques in a simple and accessible manner to foster a diverse and vibrant AI community.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>This approach links past impacts to future plans, making them credible.</p> <h2 id="future-goals">Future Goals</h2> <p>The future goals section ties everything together. It should connect your introduction, experiences, and broader impacts, showing how the opportunity you’re applying for will help you achieve your objectives and contribute to the organization’s goals.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Objective</strong>: <blockquote> <p>After completing my master’s, I plan to continue my research in robotics by pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and later becoming a research scientist. In my research career, my primary goal is to develop autonomous robots capable of reliably performing a wide range of tasks defined by humans, using natural inputs like text.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Experiences and Impacts</strong>: <blockquote> <p>My experiences in both research and industry have equipped me with the technical and interpersonal skills necessary for a successful research career. Additionally, my experiences running workshops and helping students find jobs have instilled in me a deep commitment to educating and assisting others.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>Support and Alignment</strong>: <blockquote> <p>Receiving the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship would enhance my future research by giving me the flexibility to explore areas I find both interesting and impactful, as well as the freedom to continue to help other students. Awarding the fellowship to me would enable the NSF to further its mission of advancing artificial intelligence in robotics and broadening participation in the tech field.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2 id="writing-process">Writing Process</h2> <p>My writing process generally follows four steps:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Outline</strong>: I outline the structure and organize the story.</li> <li><strong>Dump the details</strong>: I dump all details into the sections of my outline.</li> <li><strong>Edit</strong>: I revise for readability and cohesion. This involves rereading sections or using AI tools for assistance—whatever works best.</li> <li><strong>Review</strong>: I have others review my writing for readability. Incorporating their feedback is important to ensure the writing flows smoothly and is easy to understand.</li> </ol> <p>If you have further questions, feel free to reach out to me.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ahad Jawaid</name></author><category term="Graduate School"/><category term="Fellowships"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An overview of how I write my personal statements.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An Approach to the Technical Coding Interivew</title><link href="https://www.ahadjawaid.com/blog/2024/technical-interview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Approach to the Technical Coding Interivew"/><published>2024-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.ahadjawaid.com/blog/2024/technical-interview</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.ahadjawaid.com/blog/2024/technical-interview/"><![CDATA[<p>I recently started preparing for interviews again, and through discussions with friends, I noticed that how to approach technical interviews isn’t always obvious to others. While there are many people with more experience interviewing at top companies than me, I thought I’d share what has worked for me in interviews with Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Capital One, and Toyota.</p> <p>Technical interviews at big tech companies, particularly those modeled after “FAANG” (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), tend to follow a specific format. Often, you’re given a problem similar to a “LeetCode” esque question, with around 20 to 45 minutes to solve it. Some companies, like Meta, may even ask their applicants solving two questions within a 40 minutes interval.</p> <h3 id="my-formula-for-technical-coding-interviews">My Formula for Technical Coding Interviews</h3> <p>Here’s the process I typically follow during a technical interview:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Read the Problem Carefully</strong></li> <li><strong>Clarify Questions on the Problem</strong></li> <li><strong>Identify Edge Cases</strong> (Optional)</li> <li><strong>Consider Potential Solutions</strong></li> <li><strong>Confirm and Choose the Best Solution</strong></li> <li><strong>Code the Solution</strong></li> <li><strong>Dry Run Using Edge Cases</strong> (Optional)</li> </ol> <h4 id="1-read-the-problem">1. Read the Problem</h4> <p>While reading the problem, I try not to go silent. Speaking out loud helps communicate my understanding to the interviewer. Here, it’s important for me to understand the relationship between the inputs and outputs.</p> <h4 id="2-clarify-questions-on-the-problem">2. Clarify Questions on the Problem</h4> <p>After understanding the intial prompt, I validate my assumptions by asking the interviewer. Holding an incorrect assumption throughout the interview can lead to solving the wrong problem. Asking questions can prevent misunderstandings and allows me to validate the problem requirements directly with the interviewer.</p> <h4 id="3-identify-test-cases-optional">3. Identify Test Cases (Optional)</h4> <p>If time permits, I write a few test cases to better understand the problem. For example, for a problem like “two-sum,” a test case I write might look like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>array = [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 5 -&gt; [1, 2]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Specifying the expected inputs and outputs clarifies my understanding, and I validate these cases are correct with the interviewer. These initial test cases also help verify my solution once it’s implemented.</p> <h4 id="4-consider-potential-solutions">4. Consider Potential Solutions</h4> <p>Next, I start brainstorming solutions based on familiar patterns, such as “two-pointer” methods for arrays or hash maps for fast lookups. Initially, I might discuss a brute-force approach before working towards an optimized solution. When discussing each option, I evaluate its time and space complexity to justify my choice.</p> <h4 id="5-confirm-and-choose-the-best-solution">5. Confirm and Choose the Best Solution</h4> <p>Once I decide on the optimal solution, I confirm with the interviewer before coding. This helps ensure they agree with my approach, avoiding potential misunderstandings.</p> <h4 id="6-code-the-solution">6. Code the Solution</h4> <p>With the go-ahead, I start coding the solution, narrating my thought process to give insight into my choices. For example, I might say, “I’m using a dictionary here to achieve faster lookups, which reduces time complexity.” This part relies heavily on your implementation skills and effective communication.</p> <h4 id="7-dry-run-using-edge-cases-optional">7. Dry Run Using Edge Cases (Optional)</h4> <p>If there’s time, I walk through the code with my test cases, effectively “debugging” manually. I step through each line of code, tracking variable changes and outputs to ensure accuracy. For example, here’s how I might track variables:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
target = 5
i = 0
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For recursive solutions, I also simulate the call stack, which might look like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
fn(array=[1, 2, 3], target=5)
fn(array=[1, 2, 3, 4], target=5)
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="reflections-on-time-management">Reflections on Time Management</h2> <p>Managing time well during technical interviews is crucial. Many candidates can solve common patterns with enough time, but the key to standing out is delivering a clear solution within the given timeframe. For optional steps like dry-running, I adjust based on how much time remains. If I’m running low, I may skip the dry run, especially if I didn’t define edge cases earlier. Similarly, if I’m struggling to come up with the optimal solution, I’ll proceed with a simpler approach rather than leaving the problem unsolved.</p> <h2 id="preparation-strategies">Preparation Strategies</h2> <p>To do well with this formula, I focus on three skills:</p> <ol> <li>Learning algorithm patterns.</li> <li>Improving implementation skills.</li> <li>Practicing clear and interactive communication.</li> </ol> <p>For the first two, practicing problems on platforms like LeetCode is useful, while mock interviews are helpful for improving verbal explanations.</p> <p>I’ve also included some resources that helped me improve these skills:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview">Grokking the Coding Interview</a>: Useful for understanding main coding patterns.</li> <li><a href="https://neetcode.io/practice">NeetCode Practice Set</a>: A curated set of practice problems across various patterns.</li> <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions">Blind 75 LeetCode Questions</a>: A popular list of LeetCode problems that teaches you patterns.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading about my approach to technical interviews.

This post is designed to guide you through this process, sharing my key insights along the way.</p> <p>Starting with an independent study course at university, I explored deep learning intensively. To streamline the journey of understanding and implementing such papers, I’ve distilled the process into four steps:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/translating-theory-into-code/read_code_visualize_diagram.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/translating-theory-into-code/read_code_visualize_diagram.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Let’s break each one down.</p> <h2 id="read">Read</h2> <p>Reading a research paper should be focused on understanding the process rather than memorizing details. Pay attention to the inputs, outputs, data transformations, and assumptions.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/translating-theory-into-code/questions.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/translating-theory-into-code/questions.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To expedite the reading process, it helps to know where to find necessary details. Typically, the most crucial sections in a research paper are:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <ul> <li>Provides a broad understanding of the paper and its relevance.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Figures</strong></p> <ul> <li>Often encapsulate the paper’s content and are valuable for understanding the model’s workings. However, ensure their accuracy by cross-referencing the textual content.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <ul> <li>Highlights the paper’s novelty or significance.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Architecture (Can go by other names)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Contains detailed descriptions of the architecture (usually where most of your time will be spent).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Training</strong></p> <ul> <li>Provides hyperparameters for training, model performance, and other essential information.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>The appendix</strong></p> <ul> <li>Often contains implementation details not fitting into the main paper’s flow.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Experiements</strong> (Optional)</p> <ul> <li>Can include important data and parameters used for model training.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="implement">Implement</h2> <p>During implementation, the key is not to get overwhelmed by the complexity of the task. Instead, focus on the components you understand, and incrementally build upon them. It’s okay if your code isn’t flawless initially; revisions can be made as you progress.</p> <h2 id="visualize">Visualize</h2> <p>Post-implementation, validate your code. Use libraries like <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> to visualize the outputs, or tools like <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/">pytest</a> to perform tests. Working in an interactive environment like a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter notebook</a> can also be helpful.</p> <h2 id="repeat">Repeat</h2> <p>The key to successful implementation is repetition. Even if you start slowly, your pace will increase as you build your knowledge and develop better abstractions. This process also improves your programming skills.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In summary, the methodology I formulated and the key lessons I learned during my initial experience implementing a research paper can be encapsulated in four words: read, implement, visualize, and repeat. I hope you find this post beneficial, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you might have.

It could be a screw, a tire, a screen or any other task you could think of. That’s what a neural network is for software — a function that can perform any task.</p> <p>Initially, when I learned about neural networks, it seemed like a highly abstract concept that emulated the brain. However, after reading books such as Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and The Deep Learning practical coder by Jeremy Howard, I came to realize that a neural network is nothing more than a function that can be adjusted to perform any task we require of it.</p> <h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-function">What exactly is a function?</h2> <p>A function is a mapping of an input to an output. For instance, an addition function could take two numbers as inputs and output their sum.</p> <h2 id="adjustable-function">Adjustable function</h2> <p>An adjustable function, on the other hand, is a function that has weights or parameters that regulate how the inputs are modified to generate a specific output. For example, a function f that takes two numbers as inputs can be expressed as</p> <blockquote> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(input1, input2) = weight1 * input1 + weight2 * input2</code></p> </blockquote> <p>Here, we can change the function by adjusting the weights.</p> <h2 id="how-can-an-adjustable-function-learn-a-task">How can an adjustable function learn a task?</h2> <p>Now that we have established what an adjustable function is, let’s look at how we can use it to solve a problem. The process of adjusting the weights in the function to accomplish a task involves three main steps:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Get output from the function
2. Check how wrong the output is compared to 3. the desired output
4. Adjust the weights to make the output look more like the desired output
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This process can be illustrated in the following diagram:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/model.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/model.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>As simple as this may seem, this is the core of how a neural network learns a task. It starts by guessing an output, and then we adjust the weights to make it look more like the desired output.</p> <h2 id="adjusting-the-weights-automatically">Adjusting the weights automatically</h2> <p>Adjusting the weights automatically is where it gets interesting. Let’s assume you’re playing a game where someone has a number in mind, and you have to guess it. Every time you make a guess, they tell you whether you’re close or far. If you randomly pick the numbers at random, you’d get nowhere. But adding two simple steps to the process can solve this problem:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. A method to determine how far you are from the desired output (output error method)
2.A method for finding the direction and extent of the weights to be changed (method for determining how to adjust weights)
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="output-error-method">Output Error Method</h2> <p>To find how far we are from the desired output, we can subtract our function’s output and the desired output,</p> <blockquote> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(input1, input2) = 5</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goal_function(input1, input2) = 10</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error = 5–10 = -5</code></p> </blockquote> <p>The problem with this method is that it could give us negative values, which can be problematic when attempting to minimize the error. To address this issue, we can bound the method by taking the absolute value of the subtraction (positive number).</p> <blockquote> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error = | 5–10 | = 5</code></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="method-for-determining-how-to-adjust-weights">Method for determining how to adjust weights</h2> <p>The last addition to adjust the weights automatically is to find the direction and extent of the weights to be changed. We can accomplish this by using a concept from calculus known as the derivative, which is the slope of the function at a specific point. By finding the slope or derivative, we can determine the direction and amount to change the weights.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/tanget.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/tanget.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>So in this illustration, we can find that the slope at point one is two by using the rise-over run of the tangent line (a line that touches the function at a point). We can use this slope or derivative to determine in what direction and how much to change the weights. This is done because of a property that a derivative has, which is when the derivative is zero, it is at the minimum or maximum (or saddle point) of the function. We can take advantage of this property with our method of measuring the error to find the minimum of the error.</p> <p>So if we keep adjusting the weights and the derivative gets smaller, we are approaching a minimum or maximum (or saddle point). To ensure we are finding the minimum and not the maximum error, we need to figure out what direction we should change the weights. This can be done simply by subtracting the derivative to act as we descend to the minimum. Putting it together</p> <p>The heart of deep learning lies in the ability of neural networks to learn any task by going through five steps. These are:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Input data into the function
2. Compare the output to the error function (loss function)
3. Take the derivative of the error function with respect to the weights
4. Subtract the derivative of the weights from the weights
5. Repeat until the error is small
</code></pre></div></div> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/universal-function.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-universal-function/universal-function.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Everything else is focused on making the training process efficient and timely.</p> <h2 id="the-universal-function">The Universal Function</h2> <p>In conclusion, the neural network is a powerful tool that allows software to adapt to any role given to them. At first glance, it may seem like an abstract concept, but it is nothing more guessing and checking then improving. What’s fascinating about this is that the improvement can be made automatically by using concepts from calculus like the derivative, which allows us to determine how to improve. With these tools, the neural network can learn any task and solve most problem thrown its way.</p> <p>Today, we see the applications of neural networks in various fields, including speech recognition, image and pattern recognition, and natural language processing, to name a few. The possibilities of what we can achieve with this technology are endless, and we are only scratching the surface of what it can do.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ahad Jawaid</name></author><category term="Deep Learning"/><category term="Neueral Networks"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever imagined a single machine that can adapt to any role given to it?
