Hi! I'm Ahad, and I like to build cool things. In pursuit of that, I'm currently in a master's program studying computer science at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), where I'm involved in projects related to Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Speech Synthesis, and Brain-Computer Interfaces. In the future, through my current projects, I would like to create **intelligent decision-making agents** that can help people accomplish a broad range of goals defined by users in the most natural way possible.

I am currently collaborating with the [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/), advised by [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/). Prior to that, I had the pleasure of participating in a variety of opportunities. I spent one year in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program with the [Speech and Machine Learning Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/sml/), where I was advised by [Dr. Berrak Sisman](https://ece.utdallas.edu/people/tenure-system-faculty/sisman-berrak/). During the summer of 2023, I completed a Software Engineering Internship at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), working with the Natural Language Understanding team at [Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.com/). Additionally, I had the pleasure of conducting an independent study with [Dr. Doug Degroot](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/doug.degroot). Before that, I spent the summer of 2022 as an Undergraduate Researcher in the System Security Lab, advised by [Dr. Kangkook Jee](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/kangkook.jee).
